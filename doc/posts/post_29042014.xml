            Notes from a coursera course on machine learning. Machine learning problems that are classified as regression
            problems are taking input variables and mapping the output to a continuous expected result function. These
            notes provide the basic solution for a linear regression with a single variable. Otherwise known as univariate
            linear regression.

<p>The <em>hypothesis function</em> is a linear equation that we use to estimate the output function. We use a series
of steps later to resolve this function to within acceptable limits.</p>

<p>We can make intial guesses for the parameters of the hypothesis function and use a <em>cost function</em> to measure the accuracy:</p>

<p>Now that we have both an estimate in the form of an hypothesis function and a means to measure it's accuracy using
the cost function, we need a way to automatically improve our hypothesis function. For this we use a <em>gradient descent equation</em>
which, for the case of the linear regression simplifies to the following 2 equations.</p>

<img src="/data/img/grad-desc-2.png" alt="gradient descent function 2"/>

<p><em>alpha</em> is the <em>learning rate</em> of the gradient descent equation, and m is the size of the <em>training set</em>.</p>

<p>We can now repeat the gradient descent equation until the solution converges within an acceptable limit.</p>
