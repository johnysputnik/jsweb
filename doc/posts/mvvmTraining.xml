      Some great MVVM training from Karl Shifflett.

    <contents><![CDATA[I am starting a new job that means I have to return to WPF after 12 months away in the C++/Qt world. Previously at Nokia we adopted the MVVM pattern for developing a WPF media player. However we were using WPF early in its life and probably didn't implement MVVM very well.

Over on <a href="http://karlshifflett.wordpress.com/2010/11/07/in-the-box-ndash-mvvm-training/">Karl Shifflet's blog</a> is a very good training package for MVVM.

Karl is currently Program Manager on Patterns and Practices Prism Team, so knows his stuff and his blog is worth keeping an eye on.

The package itself runs within VS2010 and I just wanted to post some comments on it as I think it is a worthwhile package to download and work through if you have not fully adopted MVVM, or have issues with your implementation of it.

Â A video describing the package can be found <a href="http://vimeo.com/16643300">here</a>.

For me the highlights were the description of the Unity IOC container. I'd never done this properly and was impressed with how elegantly dependency injection can be achieved.

I can definitely recommend going through it.]]></contents>
