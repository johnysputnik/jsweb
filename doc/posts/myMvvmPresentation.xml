     I have been revising the MVVM pattern which is no doubt familiar to many developers. At CM, I have been tasked with doing a quick overview of MVVM, so have put together a powerpoint presentation. Now that powerpoint has the ability to save to video, I thought I'd record it to video.

At CM, I have been tasked with doing a quick overview of MVVM, so have put together a powerpoint presentation. Now that powerpoint has the ability to save to video, I thought I'd record it to video.

Here is the result!

It's a bit shaky, as its my first attempt at doing such a thing, but I hope it is useful enough to introduce anyone who has not worked with MVVM to what has become THE pattern for developing WPF and Silverlight applications.

The application presented as an example will be made available here as soon as I have worked out the best way to upload it. In the meantime, enjoy the presentation and my West Country accent .... I don't think it's too strong, me old lurver!]]></contents>
